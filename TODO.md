- Automations like miner, prover, daconfirmer, sequencer, and transaction speed upgrades do not trigger any animations on the block/prover/da view. For example the shake animation that occurs when clicking a block to mine or the transaction button shake that occurs when clicking a tx to add should occur when the speed upgrade and miner automations trigger.
- Show red incorrect hash on flash animation done when clicking blocks ( miner and sequencer only ), and on the last "successful" mine show a green successful hash ( enough 0s at the start based on difficulty ). Some code ( which is old and probably has bugs now ) already exists in the miner hook to generate hashes I think.
- When switching between Transactions and dApps using the transactionbuttons tabs the transactions should exit by fadeoutleft and dapps should come in by fadeinright. Then vice-versa when going dapps->transactions ( ie transactions fadeinleft and dapps fadeoutright )
- Add a tutorial that pops up after mining the first block and before buying your first transaction that shows your balance, and explains that block fees increase your balance after mining. Then After clicking "Got it" it will move on to the transaction tutorial section
- Currently audio is not playing on the phone when running there, but works fine in the iphone simulator on my pc.
- Add a terms of use page that is navigatable to thru a button on the settings page. I will insert the text into a file, so for now just use mock data in a file that I will overwrite later.
- Only show the "Claim Reward" button on the settings page if the player has reached prestige 1
- Change Foc Engine fetchs to get contracts ( Registry, Account, pow, ... ) to environment variables ( Done in focengineconnector mostly I think )
- Use shallow state management in zustand in all places applicable, where you feel there is a high-probability of improving performance. Make sure to analyze where the l2 variable is used, since it has nested types: prover and da, which are set relatively frequenctly. THere are many other potential areas to look outside of l2 as-well I believe.
- Add Bitcoin Maxi easter eggs
- Add a animation for the auto-miner, where there is a floating pick-axe ( the art should exist and is being used for an achievement currently of a pick-axe ) for each "Speed" in the upgrade. Ie once getting the first auto-miner automation, there will be a pickaxe floating that hits the block ( by quickly going towards the center and triggering a flash animation/... ) every time the miner goes off. If I get the 2nd tier of auto-miner/mining automation, there will be 2 pick-axes that hit back and forth. ...
- Change scrollviews to flatlists on achievements and store pages. Do any kinds of refactoring or optimization of current components to make this change as effective as possible at saving on performance of these pages due to large amounts of items in the scroll views.
- Add haptics/basicclick -like sound feedback from all the different Tab/Switch events ( there are 3 )
- Add shadows to components you feel would benefit from having shadows. For example I like the shadow that was added on the Dice in the username creation section of the account creation page. Keep in not the app uses a pixel art style so there may be issues with weird gaps in shadows if done in a naive-way. 
- Create a breaking animation that shows when a block is completed ( ie mined or sequenced successfully ). It will play right before the blocks slide left. Use any packages you might find that can help create a performance and nice looking "break" animation. There is very delicate timing done in all the different block components to sequence the current animation, so please make sure to adjust all of their timings to not cause any issues. ( Example components to look at: CompletedBlockView, WorkingBlockView ( the main one that needs the break animation ), and EmptyBlockView
