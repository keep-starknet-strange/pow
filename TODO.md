- Add Bitcoin Maxi easter eggs
- Add a animation for the auto-miner, where there is a floating pick-axe ( the art should exist and is being used for an achievement currently of a pick-axe ) for each "Speed" in the upgrade. Ie once getting the first auto-miner automation, there will be a pickaxe floating that hits the block ( by quickly going towards the center and triggering a flash animation/... ) every time the miner goes off. If I get the 2nd tier of auto-miner/mining automation, there will be 2 pick-axes that hit back and forth. ...
- Last hash on FLashBurst is red, not green like it should be
- UnlockDapps & UnlockL2 button not showing at appropriate times: ie UnlockDapps button doesn't disappear when a block isBuilt, and the L2Unlock doesn't show on the main/ L1 Page but shows in the store.
- WorkingBlockDetails Not scaling after initial navigation/tutorial bit

- When switching between Transactions and dApps using the transactionbuttons tabs the transactions should exit by fadeoutleft and dapps should come in by fadeinright. Then vice-versa when going dapps->transactions ( ie transactions fadeinleft and dapps fadeoutright )
