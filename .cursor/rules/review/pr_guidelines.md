# PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs small and focused; one logical change
- Provide a clear description, screenshots, and test notes
- Link issues; include acceptance criteria
- Checklist:
  - Lints/tests pass
  - No dead code or commented-out blocks
  - Types stable; no `any` introduced
  - UI changes screenshot or video
  - Contracts: include ABI/version notes if changed
