2. About the Game
POW! is an educational blockchain-based game on Starknet where players fill blocks with transactions to learn how blockchain works. As part of the gameplay, players can unlock and earn STRK tokens.
You may encounter in-game 'points' referred to as 'Bitcoin' for thematic or illustrative purposes. These in-game Bitcoin points are entirely fictional, do not represent real or actual Bitcoin, and have no monetary value. They are used purely for gameplay mechanics and educational engagement. The only digital item of real-world value that may be earned or transmitted through the game is the STRK token

Automatic Wallet Creation: When you log in, we automatically create a Starknet wallet for you. This wallet is securely linked to your login.

Play fair. Cheating, exploiting bugs, or using bots is strictly prohibited.
You are solely responsible for your account and any actions taken with it.

POW! allows players to unlock and receive STRK tokens as rewards. The amount and conditions will be communicated within the game.
Onboarding Bonus: Once you complete the game, you will be eligible to receive 10 STRK to a Starknet Account of your choice. This is a one-time reward intended to help you begin your blockchain onboarding journey.
We are not responsible for fluctuations in the value of STRK or the availability of the token.
